### **What Does This Mean?**
- You have spent **{:.1f}%** of your budget.
- The **green zone (0-70%)** means you're within a safe spending range.
- The **yellow zone (70-90%)** means you are nearing your budget limit.
- The **red zone (90-100%)** is a danger zoneâ€”you're at risk of overspending.
- The **white indicator** shows your current budget usage.
